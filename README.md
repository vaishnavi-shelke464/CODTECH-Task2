Overview of the Project
Project: Recipe Finder Application
Objective
The Recipe Finder application is a web-based platform designed to help users search for recipes based on their preferred dishes. The app fetches recipe data from an external API and presents it in an interactive, user-friendly interface, allowing users to explore the ingredients, instructions, and details about their favorite meals.

Key Features
Search Functionality: Users can search for recipes by typing the meal name into a search box.
Recipe Display: Recipes matching the search query are displayed with relevant details like name, category, cuisine, and an image of the dish.
Detailed View: A "View Recipe" button allows users to open a popup with the full recipe, including ingredients and instructions.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on different devices using a mobile-friendly layout.
Key Activities
Front-End Design:

Created an intuitive layout with HTML5 for structure and CSS for styling.
Integrated Font Awesome icons for visual enhancements (e.g., close button in the popup).
API Integration:

Used TheMealDB API to fetch meal data dynamically based on user input.
Implemented error handling to manage API request failures or invalid responses.
Dynamic Content Handling:

Rendered recipes and their details dynamically using JavaScript.
Managed user interactions with event listeners (e.g., search, button clicks).
Popup Modal:

Built a modal popup to display detailed recipe information, including ingredients and preparation instructions.
Interactive Elements:

Enabled users to search recipes and interact with the UI seamlessly.
Added a close button for exiting the recipe details popup.

Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational recipe application, combining core web development principles with API integration to deliver a functional and visually appealing user experience. It can be expanded with more advanced features for improved usability and scalability.
